## General info

Site created as passion project for friends and collegues looking to unite current and past ichthyologists, aquarists, and enthusiasts in the conservation of Madagascar's fish freshwater fish fauna.

Inspired by conversations with Tsilavina Ravelomanana, Charles Fusari, Ian Harrison and numerous others. Based upon the previous madagascarfish.org website I authored back in 2007.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript / ECMAScript 2020
- JSON
- Mapbox API
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Lightroom

## Setup

I am using this site as a practice project for basic HTML and CSS coding. While it does utilize some JavaScript and JSON, I would like this site to focus on accessability.

This file group is not intended for download and use. It is available for viewing at www.madagascarfish.com.

If there is a need/desire for download of the entire site for off-line usage please contact me alekseisaunders@gmail.com

## Status

This site is a work in progress and, I imagine, will be for sometime. As it is a static site each page needs to be hand created, leading to a deeply nested directory structure.

The short-term goal is to have multiple species pages up and viewable under their general grouping (Family, genus, etc, etc).

## Future Possibilities

Clickable range-map.
Dynamically generated location map for species-level pages - fetched from json file using Mapbox API.
Integration of Kobodatacollect to allow field-collection of data by citizen scietist.
Color schema choices
Stronger copy on multiple pages
